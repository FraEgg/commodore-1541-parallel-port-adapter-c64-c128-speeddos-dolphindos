## Description

This project includes a parallel cable set for the Commodore 1541 disk drives of types 1541-I, 1541C, and 1541-II. The basis of the project comes from [Sven Petersen's](https://github.com/svenpetersen1965/1541-parallel-adapter-SpeedDOS) parallel cable project on GitHub. The set is compatible with SpeedDOS and DolphinDOS2. However, I adapted the circuit board for my 8x switchless multi-speeder project, allowing the operation of DolphinDOS3 in addition to SpeedDOS and DolphinDOS2. The set works even without the multi-speeder.

This repository includes the Gerber and BOM files.
